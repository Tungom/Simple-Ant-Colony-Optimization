# Simple-Ant-Colony-Optimization
Implementation of the Simple Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm as described in the Book Ant Colony Optimization by Marco Dorigo
This implementation is meant for beginners in the area of Ant Colony Optimization or Python programming. The first Notebook lays a foundation and shows how the building blogs of an algorithm are laid down before being put together. The simple ant colony optiization algorithm is used to demostrate the behavior of the ant algorithm in a very simple scenario such a the bridge experiments.
